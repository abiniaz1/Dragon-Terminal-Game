# Dragon-Terminal-Game
This is a little game you can run on the terminal. It's got ASCII graphics and cool dragons!


How to Run:
You'll need to compile this in the terminal. I only know how to use the Linux GCC terminal so I can give those commands.
Have all the files in the same directory then run this command: gcc main.c -o DragonGame
This will create an executable called 'DragonGame' in the current directory. Run 'DragonGame' and you can start the game!
